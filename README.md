# Python-Game
This Gmae uses the following modules of Python -->
1. Pygame
2. Tkinter
3. numpy
4. math 
5. sys

Tkinter is used for starting interval. <br>
pygame is used for creating the main game. <br>

the game is simple it needs two users to play each one will enter the name corresponding to the colour they want.<br>
The one who makes combination of continuous four in any direction wins.<br>
Message will be displayed with name.<br>

# Some Bits About Mini Max Algorihtm --> <br>
So this Algorithm works on Two basic algorithms -- dfs and backtracking <br>
Mini-max algorithm considers all the possible moves that are possible creating a full-fledged tree and assigns branches with  certain values depending upon how you assign them like i have given max value to center column as most of the winning moves involve that column.<br>
Then what it do next is pick min and max values on alternate branches of the tree it forms --> take it as it wants to give you less value (winning with less losses) and have the highest value.<br>

<h3> Questions --> </h3><br>
<h5> 1. Any Better Algo ? </h5> <br>
--> Certainly Yes and also No . If you are going to create a matrix too big then it might require better algorithms but if its under 15-20 cells then this algo will work <br>
BETTER ALGO - Alpha - Beta Pruning <br>
<h5> 2. Complexity ? </h5><br>
--> (branches)^(depth)
